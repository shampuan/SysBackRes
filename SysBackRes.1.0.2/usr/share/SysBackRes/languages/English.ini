welcome_text = This wizard is designed to facilitate your system backup, disk cloning, image creation, image recovery and backup verification operations. The program provides reliable and fast operations using the high-performance ddrescue backend tool.\n\nSupported devices:\n- Mechanical Hard Drives\n- SSDs\n- Flash drives\n- Memory cards\n- CDs and DVDs

tech_info = Technologies Used:\n\nBackend: ddrescue for reliable disk operations and Python hashlib for hash calculations.\n\nFrontend (GUI): A lightweight and intuitive interface with Python PyQt5 library. Administrator privileges are obtained securely with PolicyKit (pkexec).

start_instruction = Click the "Start!" button to begin.

operation_selection_desc = Select the options to create an image of a healthy system or disk, write an existing image to a disk, or test the integrity of your image and click 'Next'.

backup = Backup
backup_desc = If your system is currently in good condition, it creates an image file by taking a complete copy. This is the most commonly used backup scenario.

restore = Restore
restore_desc = Writes a previously taken image file (e.g. backup.img) back to a disk of your choice. It will delete all data on the target disk.

verify = Verify
verify_desc = Checks the integrity of your image file or compares two disks with each other.

backup_type_desc = Select the method you will use for the backup operation: Image file creation or direct cloning?

create_image = Create Disk Image File
create_image_desc = Creates the image taken from the source disk with .img extension where you specify. A hash control file (.sha512) will also be created.

clone_disk = Clone disk to disk
clone_disk_desc = Clones from source disk to target disk. Make sure you select the correct target disk as it may cause irreversible data loss.

restore_type_desc = Determine the source and target for the recovery operation. Will you write an image file to disk or clone the data on the disk?

restore_img_to_disk = Restore from image to disk
restore_img_to_disk_desc = Restores a previously created image file to the selected disk. This operation completely erases the target disk.

restore_disk_to_disk = Clone disk to disk
restore_disk_to_disk_desc = Used for recovery purposes by cloning from a healthy disk to a damaged system (or a new disk).

verify_type_desc = What kind of verification operation do you want to perform? Will you check the integrity of a single image, or will you test whether two disks are exactly the same?

verify_image = Image File Integrity Check
verify_image_desc = Uses the .sha512 file next to your previously taken image file to check that the file is not corrupted and is recoverable.

verify_two_disks = Two Disk Comparison
verify_two_disks_desc = After cloning or backup operation, verifies whether the data on the source and target disks are exactly the same bit by bit.

details_desc = Please carefully select the source/target disks or files for the operation.
selections = Selections

target_not_required = Target Not Required
please_select_source = Please select Source Disk/File.
please_select_target = Please select Target Disk/File.
please_select_valid_sha512 = Please select a valid .sha512 file as Target.
source_target_same_error = Source and Target cannot be the same media! This will cause irreversible data loss.
operation_in_progress = Operation In Progress...
operation_failed = Operation could not be completed. Check the output for details.
operation_completed_successfully = Operation Completed Successfully!
operation_completed_info = Selected operation ({0}) completed successfully.\n\nClick 'OK' button to continue.
